# Elysian
so, this was my private client with venuz but grego and i decided to revive tfb https://discord.gg/BYDpzwHdBA due to how bad cruzados is rn and venuz coping also it's a skid here is the original client https://github.com/FrogDog56/Hecks.exe
# Ok so here starts the drama
unarchived this shit bc of the block game drama and i wanted to explain something
# Venuz
venuz is claiming to have done like everything on elysian when it's literally a shitty skid of hecks.exe which isn't a big deal, it has some cool modules, but venuz says he made like 90% of the new shit, you can see in commits how all his shit is incomplete, not working or just commits with nonsense shit
# skeetwho?
ok so he created a new team or something like that and they are making a backdoor so be careful with anything venuz does rn
# Conclusion
fuck venuz and thefuckboys on top as always! https://discord.gg/BYDpzwHdBA
# Also
he is now claiming he can make a custom base here is some pics of him saying that and asking me to fix literally stupid shit
